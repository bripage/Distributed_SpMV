Abstract

Introduction
	- distributed SpMV
	

Related Work
	- what they did in the FedCSIS paper
	- other stuff
	
"Methodologies"
	- hybrid instead of only multicore or multinodal with 1 MPI process per CPU
	- c++ instead of fortran
	- gcc/g++ instead of intel compilier
	- compiler settings
	- did not use BLACS or MKL libraries
	- the MPI behavior of my code mimics that of the the BLACS and MKL implementation, and achieves similar results.
		- why did you do it this way?
