Big Data as expressed as ``Big Graphs'' are growing in importance. Looking forward, there is also increasing interest in streaming versions of the associated  analytics. This paper develops an initial template for the relationship between ``traditional'' batch graph problems, and streaming forms. Variations of streaming problems are discussed, along with their relationship to existing benchmarks.
%, and then looks at their complexity in terms of basic graph parameters. This latter point is key in that if we are not careful in how we define the analytics, we could have excessive demands (especially memory) for the size of graphs we expect to see in the future.
Also included is a discussion of classes of parallel architectures (including newly emerging ones) and how such kernels are liable to scale on them. Preliminary projections for some of these systems is presented.
