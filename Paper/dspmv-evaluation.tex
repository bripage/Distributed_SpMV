\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:dspmv-evaluation}

- cluster architecture, network connectivity, number of nodes (max used), etc.
- how timings where taken and GFlops calculated based on these time measurements. 
	- note clock precision (nanoseconds)
- number of tests run per test permuation
	- best, worst, and averages were taken for all times recorded and GFlops calculated
	
- then tables and pretty graphs to talk about
