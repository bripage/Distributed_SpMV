\section{Future Work}\label{sec:dspmv-futurework}
- run computation on larger number of nodes/cores
- wider range of sparsitys and non-zero distribution within matrices
- explore performance impact of different distribution/decomposition methods
- possible explore the impact of different storage formats within the different distribution methods
- gpus/knights landing
